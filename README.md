# Trackify

An internal e-commerce app for small firms, inspired by my mom's business.  
Trackify helps businesses:

- Track sales (including sales on credit)
- View product performance in real time
- Get simple analysis on how the business is doing
- Digitalize inventory and make better decisions

The app is mainly used by employees as a way to simplify and modernize day-to-day operations.

## ✨ Motivation
I’m building this app to help my mom manage her business tasks more effectively and identify areas for improvement when it comes to sales.

## 🚧 Status: Work in Progress
Currently implemented:
- ✅ Login and signup flow (via Supabase)

Planned:
- 🔜 Sales tracking and credit management
- 🔜 Analytics dashboard
- 🔜 Better UI (button colors, overall polish)
- 🔜 Bug fix: user phone number not stored correctly on signup
